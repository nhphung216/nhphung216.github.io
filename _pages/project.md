### [My Fake GPS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lookie.fakegps)
This app will overwrite your current location to a fake location so any third-party apps, websites or services will think you are there. You can use it to test the GPS in apps, find people in different cities, fly your GPS from city to city without moving, geotag a photo, share a location on social networks or show that youâ€™re somewhere else as an excuse.
##### The app has 3 modes: 
Fixed Mode (free): It spoofs device location to a fixed fake coordinate. You can use it to spoof your real location and pretend you are somewhere else. You can test this mode on any app that uses your fixed location.
Route Mode (premium): Route Mode spoofs device location to a predetermined route. It can simulate walking, cycling and driving with different moving speed. You can test this mode in the tracking apps.
Joystick Mode (premium): Joystick Mode is the most advanced mode in GPS spoofing. It supports walking, cycling, driving and flying mode. You can go anywhere and test it in any kind of apps and games.
