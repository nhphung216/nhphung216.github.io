#### My Fake GPS
This app will overwrite your current location to a fake location so any third-party apps, websites or services will think you are there. You can use it to test the GPS in apps, find people in different cities, fly your GPS from city to city without moving, geotag a photo, share a location on social networks or show that youâ€™re somewhere else as an excuse.
