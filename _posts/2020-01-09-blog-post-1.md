This post is all about my journey through Android development which has taught me many lessons. I am writing this article because it could be helpful to many people out there who are facing problems like me.

Back in 2014, July 7th, I had my first job as an Android developer. It would be exciting for almost everyone on the first day of a job career. Same with me. I was so excited with many questions in mind, like how the company was going to be.

What would my roles and responsibilities be? And so on. But after a week or so, we all will come to understand what the things are that we need to handle.

I started my career with a startup where I didn’t have a mentor to teach me the way of learning and implementing things in software development.

I know that many of us are not going to start our career with top companies but we should take it as an advantage because here, we are going to learn things in our way. If it fails, we learn from our mistakes and try another way, spending more time at work.

A job is not like a movie where we go to spend some time and come back when the movie end. At the starting point, it’s all about our career which we are going to sail throughout our life.

It’s like building a strong foundation base. Spend more time at work or learning at the initial phase, otherwise you are going to face something unexpected in the future. I know that every one of us has family and other responsibilities, but keep a balance on everything.

Learn something from each mistake. Do not repeat them.

Some of my experiences that could help others.
