This post is all about my journey through Android development which has taught me many lessons. I am writing this article because it could be helpful to many people out there who are facing problems like me.

Back in 2014, July 7th, I had my first job as an Android developer. It would be exciting for almost everyone on the first day of a job career. Same with me. I was so excited with many questions in mind, like how the company was going to be.

What would my roles and responsibilities be? And so on. But after a week or so, we all will come to understand what the things are that we need to handle.

I started my career with a startup where I didn’t have a mentor to teach me the way of learning and implementing things in software development.

I know that many of us are not going to start our career with top companies but we should take it as an advantage because here, we are going to learn things in our way. If it fails, we learn from our mistakes and try another way, spending more time at work.

A job is not like a movie where we go to spend some time and come back when the movie end. At the starting point, it’s all about our career which we are going to sail throughout our life.

It’s like building a strong foundation base. Spend more time at work or learning at the initial phase, otherwise you are going to face something unexpected in the future. I know that every one of us has family and other responsibilities, but keep a balance on everything.

Learn something from each mistake. Do not repeat them.

Some of my experiences that could help others.

### Learn Before You Code

Many of us, after getting a task to do, we straightaway hit the IDE to get the result. We use our expertise to Google the things and copy-paste them. Sooner or later, we will find out that everything can’t be done in that way.

So, if a task or feature is assigned to be implemented, try to give your best. First of all, think about how we are going to solve the problem, secondly, what are we learning from it, and lastly, is this the optimized way of doing it?

Every one of us codes to get the result, and keeps on doing the same thing for years. I too had done the same thing until I met some people who I should thank for making me look at things differently.

Before starting and hitting the IDE, estimate your work effectively. Everything you do, try to make a new learning experience out of it. Do things differently, try to implement older stuff in newer ways so that you don’t get bored.

For example, I had used findViewById(R.id.xxx) for almost two years. I was used to it. Although Butter Knife came to ease some things I was not aware of it because I didn’t spend time exploring.

I just wanted my code to run and get the result on mobile. But later, when I started using Butter Knife, and later Kotlin synthetic imports, I understood the ease of doing things. So, keep on exploring things…

Keep learning, never stop. Try different approaches for the same task.

#### Check for Optimization
There is always room for improvement. Once we get the desired output, we ourselves or the QA (Quality Assurance) team test the build and release it to production.

But getting the desired outputs is not the only most important thing we need to check as to how the feature we implemented affects the performance of an app.

There may be a lot of reasons like bad CPU usage, unnecessary memory consumption, poor implementation of battery resources, etc.

To debug and overcome these issues, in Android Studio 3.0, there is a section called Profiler. A Profiler is a suite of tools to explore, optimize, and troubleshoot performance.

With Profilers, you can measure UI performance for situations like frame, drops, and check for view hierarchies. Slow rendering creates a very bad user experience. Make use of Profile GPU rendering, Systrace, layout inspector, and the benefits of ConstraintLayout.

Check out my posts on Profilers and improving UI performance to get an idea of how you can optimize your apps.

Make a habit of measuring the performance of the app before release. This will give better results.

#### Coding Standards

Writing something and getting output is a thing that everyone can do providing little assistance. But writing clean and maintainable code is a little hard in the beginning.

At the starting point, we don’t have exposure to code so with our knowledge, we write the name of methods and variables as per our understanding which may be difficult for others to understand.

I too had a difficult time for six months at an early phase in my career. In these six months, every time I wrote something, I used to get bad feedback for one thing or the other.

The code we write should be easily understood by everyone on the team, it should be easy to modify. Don’t think of great names, it’s just a matter of naming that everyone should accept.

In some companies, you can find some predefined naming standards so we just need to follow them rather than creating new ones.

For classes that extend an Android component, the name of the class should end with the name of the component. For example, LoginActivity, SignUpFragment, DownloaderService, CustomDialog.

Resources file names are written in lowercase_underscore. For example, for images or icons, we use ic_ as the prefix. If the image is tickmark then we name it ic_tickmark.

For layout files, we use the component_class_name format. If there is a LoginActivity, the layout name will be activity_login. If there was a SignUpFragment we use fragment_sign_up as layout file name.

The coding standards can improve readability and maintainability of the code and it reduces complexity of understanding things.

#### Testing

Testing has gained more importance these days. Nowadays, everyone is asking to write test cases while developing. JUnit test cases are most commonly used for testing the logical parts.

Levels of testing:

Small tests are unit tests that validate your app’s behavior, one class at a time.

Medium tests are integration tests that validate either interaction between levels of the stack within a module or interactions between related modules.

Large tests are end-to-end tests that validate user journeys spanning multiple modules of your app.

It is better that we follow test-driven development(TDD) when developing our apps. Rather than doing testing after the entire product is finished, we need to start at the very initial phase. Find out more about falling in love with Android Testing.

Though following TDD is not so easy, it’s useful to limit the flaws to the max extent possible.

#### Architectural Patterns

Until we have two to three years of experience, some of us might not have heard the term architecture. But it is very important to know about architecture. Architecture is nothing but the way we implement our apps.

The common scenario is, if joining any new organizations when we start bug fixing then we come to know how painful it was and give blessings to the master who wrote that shitty code, it may not be true in all cases.

But who knew the importance of architecture would have followed it so that you will understand the importance because of the ease of changeability.

There are many architectures out there like MVC, MVP, MVVM, Clean, etc. It is totally dependent on the complexity of our app to decide which architecture to use.

Keep in mind that mobile devices are also resource-constrained, so at any time, the operating system might kill some app processes to make room for new ones.

The most important principle to be followed while developing the apps was separation of concerns.

These UI-based classes like activity or fragments should only contain logic that handles UI and operating system interactions. By keeping these classes as lean as possible, you can avoid many lifecycle-related problems. Keep the model classes independent of UI.

Architecture would be more helpful for changeability in case there are any future modifications to the developed feature or testability.

#### Security Implementations

As you are an Android developer, you might have known about APK decoding.

It is a process by which an APK file can be decoded and the third person can see your class files and resource files. We need to apply ProGuard to our apps while generating the signed APK.

ProGuard helps to shrink, obfuscate, and optimize our app.
